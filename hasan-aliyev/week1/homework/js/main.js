//PART 1

// Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
// Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
// Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
// Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
// Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.


const squareNumber = function (num) {
  const result = `The result of squaring the number ${num} is ${num*num}.`;
  return result;
}
console.log(squareNumber(3));
//
//

const halfNumber = function (halfNum) {
  const result = `Half of ${halfNum} is ${halfNum/2}.`;
  return result;
}
console.log(halfNumber(5));
//
//
const percentOf = function (num1, num2) {
  const result = `number ${num2/num1} is 50% of number ${num2}.`
  return result;
};
console.log(percentOf(5,10));

//
// Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
//
// Take half of the number and store the result.
// Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).




// DrEvil
// Create a function called DrEvil. It should take a single argument, an amount, and return ' dollars', except it will add '(pinky)' at the end if the amount is 1 million. For example:
//
//   DrEvil(10): 10 dollars
//   DrEvil(1000000): 1000000 dollars (pinky)
// MixUp
// Create a function called mixUp. It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. For example:
//
//   mixUp('mix', 'pod'): 'pox mid'
//   mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
// Look up the JavaScript string reference to find methods which may be useful!
// FixStart
// Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurences of its first character have been replaced with '*', except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:
//
// fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
// Verbing
// Create a function called verbing. It should take a single argument, a string. If its length is at least 3, it should add 'ing' to its end, unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case it should add 'ly' instead. If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it unchanged. For example:
//
//   verbing('swim'): 'swimming'
//   verbing('swimming'): 'swimmingly'
//   verbing('go'): 'go'
// Not Bad
// Create a function called notBad that takes a single argument, a string.
//
// It should find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'.
// If the 'bad' follows the 'not', then it should replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good' and return the result.
// If it doesn't find 'not' and 'bad' in the right sequence (or at all), just return the original sentence.
// For example:
//
//   notBad('This dinner is not that bad!'): 'This dinner is good!'
//   notBad('This movie is not so bad!'): 'This movie is good!'
//   notBad('This dinner is bad!'): 'This dinner is bad!'


Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:

If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.
Examples
28 has 7 as a factor.
In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.
In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.
Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".


function factors(n)
{
 var num_factors = [], i;

 for (i = 1; i <= Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n)); i += 1)
  if (n % i === 0)
  {
   num_factors.push(i);
   if (n / i !== i)
    num_factors.push(n / i);
  }
 num_factors.sort(function(x, y)
   {
     return x - y;});  // numeric sort
     return num_factors;
    }
console.log(factors(15));  // [1,3,5,15]
console.log(factors(16));  // [1,2,4,8,16]
console.log(factors(17));  // [1,17]


























// Write a function named greaterNum that:
//
// takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
// returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
// Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").


var greaterNum = function (x, y) {
  if (x > y) {
    return x;
  }
  else {
    return y;
  }
};
  console.log(greaterNum(5, 4));


  // Write a function named helloWorld that:
  //
  // takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
  // returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for atleast 3 languages. It should default to returning English.
  // Call that function for each of the supported languages and log the result to make sure it works.

  var helloWorld = function (lang) {
      if (lang == 'fr') {
          return 'Bonjour tout le monde';
      } else if (lang == 'es') {
          return 'Hola, Mundo';
      } else {
          return 'Hello, World';
      }
  }

  console.log(helloWorld('en'));
  console.log(helloWorld('fr'));
  console.log(helloWorld('es'));

//
//   Write a function named assignGrade that:
//
// takes 1 argument, a number score.
// returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F" (for example, scores above 90 receive an "A", scores between 90 and 80 receive a "B", and so on).
// Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.



var assignGrade = function (score) {
  if (score >= 90) {
    return 'A';
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    return 'B';
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    return 'C';
  } else if (score >= 60) {
    return 'D';
  } else if (score <= 50) {
  return 'F';
  }
};
console.log(assignGrade(45));


// Write a function named pluralize that:
//
// takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
// returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".
// Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
// Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and "geese".

const pluralize = function (x, noun) {
  const result = `${x} ${noun}`;
  return result;
};
console.log(pluralize(5, 'cats'));



//
//
//

function pluralize(noun, number) {
    if (number != 1 && noun != 'sheep' && noun != 'geese') {
        return number + ' ' + noun + 's';
    } else {
        return number + ' ' + noun;
    }
}
console.log('I have ' + pluralize('cat', 0));
console.log('I have ' + pluralize('cat', 1));
console.log('I have ' + pluralize('cat', 2));

console.log('hi');
